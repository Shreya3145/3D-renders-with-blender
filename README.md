# 3D Renders with Blenderz 

Welcome to my 3D Renders with Blenderz repository! This repo is a showcase of my 3D modeling and rendering projects created using Blender.

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A portfolio of my 3D models and renders.
- A personal space to track my progress and growth in 3D modeling.
- A place to experiment with new techniques and workflows in Blender.

## Contents
The repository includes:
- **Models** – Raw and exported 3D models (.blend, .obj, .fbx).
- **Textures** – Custom textures and materials used in the models.
- **WIP (Work in Progress)** – Unfinished models and experimental projects.
- **Renders** – Final rendered images and animations (still working on it).

## How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-renders-with-blenderz.git
   ```
2. Open the .blend files with Blender (Version 3.x or higher recommended).
3. Modify, render, or export the models as needed.
